# Model Package

This package contains the data models for the application. These classes represent the core entities such as:
- `Ministry`
- `MinistryExpense`
- `RevenueCategory`
- `ExpenseCategory`
- `BudgetYear`
- `Summary`
- `SqlSequence`

These models are used to transfer data between the database (DAO layer) and the application logic.
